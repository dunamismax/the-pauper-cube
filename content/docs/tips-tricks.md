# Tips & Tricks
## Advanced Strategies for Pauper Cube Masters

## Format Characteristics

### What Makes Pauper Cube Unique

**Games are Grindy**
- Most games go 8+ turns
- 2-for-1s are extremely valuable
- Incremental advantage wins games

**No True Board Wipes**
- Creatures tend to stick around
- Combat is important every turn
- Positioning matters more

**Combat Tricks Are Better**
- Fewer instant-speed answers
- Tricks often 2-for-1
- Bluffs are powerful

**Monarch is King**
- Monarch cards are format warping
- Card draw is at a premium
- Control the crown, control the game

<div class="priority-section">
<strong>Golden Rule:</strong> Protection (like Guardian of the Guildpact) is nearly unbeatable in this format.
</div>

## Creature Evaluation

### Evasive Creatures

Creatures with flying, shadow, or other forms of evasion are premium threats. In a format dominated by creature combat, being able to attack without being blocked is a huge advantage.

- **Top Evasive Threats:** Soltari Trooper, Kor Skyfisher, Mist Raven, Pestermite, Cloudkin Seer

### Resilient Creatures

Creatures that are difficult to remove or that generate value when they die are highly valuable. Look for creatures with recursion, undying, or that create tokens upon death.

- **Top Resilient Threats:** Doomed Traveler, Carrier Thrall, Putrid Goblin, Safehold Elite, Nested Shambler

**Crypt Rats**  
- Closest thing to a board wipe
- Clears aggressive starts
- Reusable with sufficient mana

**Pestilence**
- Game-dominating enchantment  
- Clears boards repeatedly

**Rolling Thunder**

### Trap Cards That Look Good

**Avoid These:**
- **Expensive Auras** - Too much risk
- **Situational Counters** - Not worth a card
- **Pure Card Selection** - Need actual advantage
- **Symmetric Effects** - Opponents benefit too

## Advanced Drafting Strategies

### Signal Reading

**Early Picks (1-5):**
- Premium removal wheeling = color open
- Good 2-drops going late = avoid aggro
- Expensive cards moving = control might be open

**Mid Picks (6-10):**
- Confirm initial reads
- Look for archetype staples
- Identify what neighboring drafters are doing

**Late Picks (11-15):**
- Take anything playable
- Grab sideboard cards
- Note what's not getting picked

### Hate Drafting

**When to Hate Draft:**
- Opponent's key synergy piece
- Cards that punish your strategy
- Extremely powerful splash cards
- When you have nothing else

**When NOT to Hate Draft:**
- You need playables
- The card doesn't affect you
- Early in pack 1
- It's not actually that good

## Combat & Gameplay Tips

### Combat Mathematics

**Key Combat Rules:**
- Always consider tricks
- Opponent's mana matters more than cards in hand
- Trading is often correct in this format
- Don't be afraid to take damage early

**When to Block:**
- You're behind on board
- You can make a profitable trade  
- You need to preserve life total
- Opponent has reach/burn

**When NOT to Block:**
- You're racing successfully
- Trade would be unprofitable
- You have better ways to interact
- You need to preserve creatures

### Sequencing

**Early Game (Turns 1-4):**
- Play threats on curve
- Hold up interaction when possible
- Develop mana before committing to colors
- Save premium removal for bigger threats

**Mid Game (Turns 5-8):**
- Focus on board presence
- Card advantage becomes critical
- Start planning win conditions
- Manage resources carefully

**Late Game (Turns 9+):**
- Every card matters
- Look for finishing combinations
- Preserve answers for threats
- Don't overextend into tricks

## Archetype-Specific Secrets

### Flicker (WU) Tricks
- Always sequence to maximize ETB triggers
- Kor Skyfisher can "flicker" opponent's permanents
- Archeomancer + Ephemerate = repeatable value
- Mulldrifter is the best win condition

### Control (UB/UW) Mastery  
- Don't counter everything - pick your battles
- Card draw is more important than counterspells
- Win conditions matter less than answers
- Play at instant speed whenever possible

### Aggro (RW/BR/WB) Excellence
- Damage is damage - don't overthink  
- Burn to face is often correct
- 16 lands is sometimes right
- Know when to go all-in

### Spells Matter (UR) Optimization
- Count your spells constantly
- Prowess triggers stack
- Cheap spells > expensive spells
- Card selection finds the missing pieces

## Sideboarding Guide

### Always Bring In
- **Artifact/Enchantment Hate:** Naturalize effects

- **Life Gain:** vs aggressive decks

### Consider Sideboarding
