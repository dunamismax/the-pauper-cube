<div class="priority-section">
<strong>Draft Format:</strong> 3 packs of 15 cards each • Pick 1, pass remaining • 45 cards total • Build a 40-card deck
</div>

## Deck Building Formula

<div class="deck-formula">

| **Component** | **Count** | **Notes** |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Lands** | 17 (16-18 range) | Base for 2-color deck |
| **Creatures** | 14-17 | Core of most decks |
| **Removal** | 3-6 | Premium picks! |
| **Other Spells** | 3-5 | Card draw, tricks, etc. |
| **Total Cards** | **40 exactly** | Never more! |

</div>

### Mana Curve Goals

- **4-mana:** 3-5 cards
- **5+ mana:** 2-4 cards

<div class="priority-section">
<strong>Critical Rule:</strong> 2-mana creatures are the backbone of Pauper Cube. Prioritize them highly!

{{< columns >}}

**High Priority:**
- 2-mana creatures (format backbone)
- Removal spells (always scarce)
- Card advantage (draw, 2-for-1s)
- Fixing lands (enables splashes)

**Medium Priority:**
- Evasive creatures
- Combat tricks
- Cheap aggressive creatures
- Mana dorks

{{< /columns >}}

### Avoid Trap Cards

- Expensive cards without immediate impact
- Situational counters/combat tricks  
- Auras (unless hexproof/protection)
- Cards that require specific synergies

## Draft Strategy by Archetype

### Aggressive Strategies (RW, WB, BR)

**Key Cards:**
- 1-2 mana creatures
- Burn spells
- Combat tricks
- Token generators

**Strategy:**
- Take cheap creatures early
- Value damage over card advantage
- 16 lands often correct
- Finish games by turn 6-7

### Control Strategies (UB, UW)

**Key Cards:**
- Removal and counterspells
- Card draw
- Large finishers
- Board control

**Strategy:**
- Take removal very highly
- 18 lands often correct  
- Win with 1-2 big threats
- Value 2-for-1s above all

### Midrange Strategies (GW, BG, WB)

**Key Cards:**
- Efficient creatures
- Value engines
- Versatile removal
- Incremental advantage

**Strategy:**
- Balance curve carefully
- Take best card available
- 17 lands standard
- Adapt to what's open

## Advanced Draft Tips

### Reading Signals

**Pack 1:**
- Premium removal wheeling = color open
- Aggressive creatures late = aggressive decks overdrafted
- Fixing lands late = greedy mana bases rewarded

**Pack 2:**
- Confirm your archetype
- Hate-draft opposing strategies
- Pick up sideboard cards

**Pack 3:**
- Fill curve gaps
- Take lands if needed  
- Grab late role-players

### Common Mistakes

- **Forcing archetypes** - Stay flexible early  
- **Ignoring curve** - Even control needs 2-drops  
- **Overdrafting colors** - Watch for signals  
- **Neglecting removal** - Take it highly always  
- **Playing 41+ cards** - Stick to 40 exactly

<div class="priority-section">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In Pauper Cube, games are grindy and incremental advantage matters. A 2-for-1 is often better than a "bomb."
